Instead we're 15th and on the second page. Howevever, we're not likely going to ever win this search. The intent of most people searching for "stickies" is to locate physical sticky notes. SEM is also a bad idea. Stickies is a $9 keyword.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We're not going to get much value from any digital marketing campaign. "Stickies" is too competitive a term, and we would also have an education problem if someone landed on Stickies.io while looking for actual post-it notes. So we should focus on other channels to grow Stickies. We already rely on referrals to bring people to boards and we should benchmark this to understand the real impact.</p>

Stickies is something that we do, so this will generate some traffic. We should not do this immediately, but only after we've gotten Stickies to a place where we're comfortable driving more traffic to it.</p>
